    <h1>Internet Movie Dataviz</h1>
    <h3><em>26-09-22</em></h3>
    <p>Sometimes I watch movies and sometimes I write code. Lying in the
    middle of these two is the creation of data visualizations. Here is a
    random collection of graphs from a data analysis on a movie dataset.
    These figures each tell a story of their own.</p>
    <span style="font-size: small">
     This project was done as the capstone project for the
    Google Data Analytics course on Coursera: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" class="uri">https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics</a>.
    The dataset is from the GroupLens website, a site for comparing and
    getting recommendations on movies, found at: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset</a>.
    An SQL database was created from this dataset. Queries were run using
    SQL, and results were processed using R. Figures were plotted using
    Plotly in R.

<h2>Top-rated Movies</h2>
<p>For fun, I plotted the best rated movies on GroupLens. Movies were
filtered for having over 100 reviews to remove inaccurate outliers. Is
your favorite among them?</p>
<object class="graph_importer" type="text/html" data="/imd_graphs/top_ratings.html"></object>

<h2>Budget vs Rating</h2>
<p>Next, I was interested in determining if movie budget has any
influence on the eventual ratings of a movie. This is visualized as a
line in the graph, resulting from a regression analysis. At first glance
the correlation appears negative. However, at an R-squared value of 0.01
we can conclude that the budget of a movie holds no substantial correlation to the
rating.</p>
<p><font size="1"> Note: information on budget is not available for all
movies. These were filtered out. </font></p>
<object class="graph_importer" type="text/html" data="/imd_graphs/budget_vs_rating.html"></object>

    <pre><code>## [1] R-squared:
## [1] 0.01037655</code></pre>

    <h2>Popularity of genres</h2>
<p>In this graph the number of times a movie is tagged with a certain
genre. Note that one movie can have multiple tags. You can click to show
or hide genres.</p>

<p>Judging the results, it is obvious the dataset has some flaws. Many
movies lack genre tags, especially older movies. One way to solve this
would be to look at the total amount of movies released each year -
which you can do by clicking <em>Total movies released</em>.
Alternatively, we can take a genre count as a ratio of all genres -
which you can do by selecting the stacked area chart from the second tab
<em>Stacked area</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, in <em>Ratings per genre</em> we can see the distribution of
ratings for each genre. This was calculated by taking the average rating
per movie, and looking at the primary genre that was listed.</p>

    <div class="tab">
          <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Line chart')" id="defaultOpen">Line chart</button>
          <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Stacked area')">Stacked area</button>
          <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Ratings per genre')">Ratings per genre</button>

          <script>
            function openTab(evt, tabName) {
              var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
              tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");
              for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
                tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
              }
              tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablinks");
              for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
                tablinks[i].className = tablinks[i].className.replace(" active", "");
              }
              document.getElementById(tabName).style.display = "block";
              evt.currentTarget.className += " active";
                }
        </script>
    </div>



    <div id="Line chart" class="tabcontent">
<p>From this graph it’s clear to see which are the most popular genres.
Drama, Action and Thriller dominate.</p>
<p>Many genres show an increase in tags through time. Especially
Documentary has seen a huge uptick. Western is an exception here: in
latter-day the genre seems almost died out.</p>
    <object class="graph_importer" type="text/html" data="/imd_graphs/genres_through_time.html"></object>
    </div>

    <div id="Stacked area" class="tabcontent">
<p>Some interesting trends through time can be detected using this
graph. As mentioned at <em>Line chart</em>, since the 2000’s
Documentary’s seems to be booming in popularity. Similarly, Western’s
had a substantial share back in the 50’s through 70’s, but have since
disappeared. As you would expect, Animation movies only start appearing
around the 80’s. Some genres are more stable: Drama has always been
dominant.</p>
<p>At the extremes of the x-axis dates, the graph starts to fall apart.
Not enough data is available for these sections.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="Ratings per genre" class="tabcontent">
<p>Some genres score exceptionally high when comparing these
distributions. For instance, Animation, Documentary and War. All seemed
skewed towards higher ratings.</p>
<p>This graph also reveals the unfortunate truth about one of my
favorite genres: not many good horror-movies exist.</p>
