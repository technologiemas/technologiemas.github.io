    <p>What you are looking at is Conway&#39;s game of life.
    A two-dimensional world of living square cells.
    These cells are in connection to each of their eight neighbours, on which their survival depends.</p>
    <p>The game is based on sequential generations. Creation and survival of cells mimics a population via reproduction, and under- and overpopulation.</p>
    <p>The status of living for each cell is determined based on a few simple rules:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A dead cell with three neighbours alive becomes a living cell.</li>
    <li>A living cell with fewer than two neighbours dies.</li>
    <li>A living cell with more than three neighbours dies.</li>
    <li>A living cell with two or three neighbours survives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You might notice some patterns are stable. Stability might be static, or even moving.
    Due to this fact a programmable automaton can be created. In other words, a computer. </p>
